(note for developers)

The mapper (keez) is an C++ object, which has the following public methods:
1. blockKey and unblockKey -- remap key with xmodmap in order to prevent default handler from occuring.
2. sethandler -- set user handler to event (key up/down/press)
3. sendkey(up/down/press, code) -- imitate keyboard event
4. reset -- restore initial xmodmapping

On Ctrl+C 'reset' is also called to restore initial xmodmapping
